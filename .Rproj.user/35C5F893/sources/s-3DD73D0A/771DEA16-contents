title: "Test your R install!"
output: html_document
---

This is an R install test document.  We compile it in a way that the
code will not be visible, you will just have the output.  Imagine this
is a report, and your boss is deeply uninterested in the code.  But
she very much wants to see the results!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Load data from a non-default package

```{r cars}
data(father.son, package="UsingR")
```

Here we loaded data (Galton 1886 parents/children height data) from
package _UsingR_.  You probably have to install that package.

## Use **dplyr** commands

Here we use dplyr to convert inches to centimeters.  In the original
data the height is given in inches.  If it works, you
have a functioning dplyr installation.

```{r}
fs <- father.son %>% 
  mutate(fheight=fheight*2.54,
         sheight=sheight*2.54)
```


## Do some plotting

Finally, here is the plot of the data.  The dots should be centered
around 170..180 cm for both horizontally (fathers) and vertically
(sons).  The chunk option `message=FALSE` should remove the message
"geom_smooth() using formula...`.  You should _not_ see this message in
the final document.

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(fs, aes(fheight, sheight)) +
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="orangered3") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Fathers height (cm)",
       y = "Sons height (cm)")
```

The black dots depict parent-child pairs (although the data claims it
is about fathers and sons, Galton was in fact also using mothers and
daughters).  The red line is one-to-one relationship, meaning that one
cm taller parents have in average one cm taller children.  As the blue
regression line shows, this is not at all the case.  Taller parents
have taller children, but not as much above the mean as parents.  This
is what Galton (1886) called "regression to mean".


## Submission

If unsure, feel free to submit the lab and we'll tell you if you
submitted the right things.  You should submit:

* rmd file (this one)
* the final html (or pdf)

and the same for notebook:

* notebook .ipynb
* final html (or pdf)
