### Load the Data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

meth <- read.delim("yrbs.tsv.bz2")

meth %>% # yrbs is the dataset
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(`Meth use`= mean(meth),
  .groups="drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, `Meth use`, col=state)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2006) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009),
  labels=c("2003", "2005", "2006\nThe year of campaign", "2007", "2009")) +
  labs(y="Mean of 'have you ever tried meth'") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

### 1. Identifying Assumption

DID assumes that without the treatment, Montana would have changed similarly to the rest of the country. 

### 2. Is it plausible

This assumption is not completely plausible, because the ad campaign took place in 2006 yet the biggest difference-in-differences happened between 2007 and 2009, not between 2005 and 2007 as one would expect of the ad campaign was the biggest factor. 

#2. Difference in Differences Estimator

### 1. Creating auxiliary variables

```{r}
meth <- meth %>% mutate(T = state == "MT", A = year > 2006)
```

### 2. Four-way Table
```{r}
table <- meth %>%
  group_by(T, A) %>%
  summarize(meth = mean(meth))

table
```
The DiD in meth usage is as follows:
```{r}
(filter(table, T, A)['meth'] - filter(table, !T, A)['meth'])- 
  (filter(table, T, !A)['meth'] - filter(table, !T, !A)['meth'])
```

### 3. Compute using Linear Regression

```{r}
meth <- mutate(meth, TA = T * A)
lm(meth ~ T + A + TA, data = meth) %>% summary()
```

The DiD is -0.0182, same as before. 

### Regression with full controls

```{r}
lm(meth ~ T + A + TA + age + sex+tv, data = meth) %>% summary()
```

### 5. Final effect

The effect with full controls is -0.0185, which is nearly the same as with no controls. This actually somewhat weakens the assumption that the TV ad campaign had a major impact on meth use, because including TV use as a control had barely any impact on the results. If TV ads significantly impacted meth use, one might expect that would show up as a major correlation.

```{r}

lm(meth ~ T + A + TA + age + sex+tv + tv*T, data = meth) %>% summary()
```

To investigate this I ran the regression looking at the interaction of tv use with residence in Montana, and surprisingly watching TV was *negatively* correlated with meth use in general, but *positively* correlated in the state of Montana (although this was not statistically significant), casting more doubt that the TV ads were the reason for the decline. 

```{r}
lm(meth ~ T + A + TA, data = filter(meth, tv == 1)) %>% summary()
```
My final experiment was to run the same DiD only on TV users. This is not my ideal structure - ideally I would like a variable showing whether someone watched TV in 2006 and selecting all those people across all years, but since I don't have that, I may be getting different people in different years. However, the fact that the effect of treatment gets stronger when looking only at TV users suggests that perhaps the treatment was the reason for the decline after all.
